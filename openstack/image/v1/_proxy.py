            of an image, the name will be constructed from the extensionless
            basename of the path.
        :param str filename: The path to the file to upload, if needed.
            (optional, defaults to None)
        :param data: Image data (string or file-like object). It is mutually
            exclusive with filename
        :param str container: Name of the container in swift where images
            should be uploaded for import if the cloud requires such a thing.
            (optional, defaults to 'images')
        :param str md5: md5 sum of the image file. If not given, an md5 will
            be calculated.
        :param str sha256: sha256 sum of the image file. If not given, an md5
            will be calculated.
        :param str disk_format: The disk format the image is in. (optional,
            defaults to the os-client-config config value for this cloud)
        :param str container_format: The container format the image is in.
            (optional, defaults to the os-client-config config value for this
            cloud)
        :param list tags: List of tags for this image. Each tag is a string
            of at most 255 chars.

            flags to the image to inform the cloud in question to not expect a
            vendor agent to be runing. (optional, defaults to True)
        :param allow_duplicates: If true, skips checks that enforce unique
            image name. (optional, defaults to False)
        :param meta: A dict of key/value pairs to use for metadata that
            bypasses automatic type conversion.
        :param bool validate_checksum: If true and cloud returns checksum,
            compares return value with the one calculated or passed into this
            call. If value does not match - raises exception. Default is
            'false'

        metadata for the image and will have all values converted to string
        except for min_disk, min_ram, size and virtual_size which will be
        converted to int.

        If you are sure you have all of your data types correct or have an
        advanced need to be explicit, use meta. If you are just a normal
        consumer, using kwargs is likely the right choice.
