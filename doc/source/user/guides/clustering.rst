Using OpenStack Clustering
================================

Before working with the Clustering service, you'll need to create a
connection to your OpenStack cloud by following the :doc:`connect` user guide.
This will provide you with the ``conn`` variable used by all examples in this
guide.

The primary abstractions/resources of the Clustering service are:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Profile Type <clustering/profile_type>
   Profile <clustering/profile>
   Cluster <clustering/cluster>
   Node <clustering/node>
   Policy Type <clustering/policy_type>
   Policy <clustering/policy>
   Receiver <clustering/receiver>
   Action <clustering/action>
   Event <clustering/event>
