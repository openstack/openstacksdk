    Add the ``validate_console_auth_token`` method to the Compute proxy. This
    method uses the pre-existing ``os-console-auth-tokens`` OpenStack Compute
    API to validate a console access token as produced by
    ``get_console_url``. In addition, the method returns hypervisor connection
    information for the console (hypervisor IP and port numbers), as this call
    is generally used by the console proxies which users connect to.

    By default, callers of this method must have ``admin`` access to the
    OpenStack Compute API due to the privileged nature of the hypervisor
    connection information returned.
