    A new parameter, ``max_items``, is added to the ``Resource.list``
    method. This allows users to specify the maximum number of resources
    that should be returned to the user, as opposed to the maximum number
    of items that should be requested from the server in a single request.
    The latter is already handled by the ``limit`` parameter
