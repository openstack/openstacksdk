    openstacksdk was publishing metrics to the global Prometheus collector
    registry (``prometheus_client.REGISTRY``) if the ``prometheus-client``
    library was installed, but the ``Connection`` object was not configured
    to publish Prometheus metrics to a custom registry. This was causing the
    global Prometheus collector registry to be polluted with potentially
    unwanted metrics, and was also a potential cause of memory leaks if
    openstacksdk is used to make a large number of requests. This issue has
    now been fixed; openstacksdk will only publish Prometheus metrics when
    ``collector_registry`` has been passed to the connection object, and
    will only publish to that registry.
