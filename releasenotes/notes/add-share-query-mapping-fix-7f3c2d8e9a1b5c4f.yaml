    Fixed the ``Share`` resource in the shared file system service to properly
    support query parameters when listing shares. Previously, query parameters
    such as ``all_tenants`` were silently ignored because the ``_query_mapping``
    attribute was missing. This affected admin users trying to list shares
    across all projects, as well as filtering by status, name, and other
    attributes.
